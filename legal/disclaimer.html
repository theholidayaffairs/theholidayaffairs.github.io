            <p>The Holiday Affairs provides travel-related information, recommendations, and services for informational
                purposes only. While we strive to offer accurate and updated content, we make no warranties or
                guarantees
                about the completeness, reliability, or accuracy of the information provided.</p>
        </ul>
        <h4>2. Travel Risks & Responsibilities</h4>
        <ul>
            <p>Traveling involves inherent risks, including delays, cancellations, safety concerns, and unexpected
                circumstances. The Holiday Affairs is not responsible for any losses, injuries, damages, or disruptions
                caused by travel-related activities. It is the traveler's responsibility to verify visa requirements,
                health
                and safety regulations, travel advisories, and local laws before booking.</p>
        </ul>
        <h4>3. Third-Party Services & Links</h4>
        <ul>
            <p>The Holiday Affairs Website may feature third-party services, hotel bookings, tours, transportation, and
                external links. We do not own, operate, or control these third-party providers and are not liable for
                their
                actions, pricing, availability, or service quality. Users should review the terms, conditions, and
                policies
                of third-party providers before making any reservations.</p>
        </ul>
        <h4>4. No Liability for Travel Service Providers</h4>
        <ul>
            <p>The Holiday Affairs may recommend hotels, airlines, tour operators, and local experiences. We do not
                guarantee the performance or reliability of these services and will not be responsible for
                cancellations,
                delays, pricing discrepancies, or service failures. Any issues must be addressed directly with the
                service
                provider.</p>
        </ul>
        <h4>5. Health & Safety Advisory</h4>
        <ul>
            <p>Travelers are responsible for ensuring they meet medical, vaccination, and insurance requirements for
                their
                destinations. The Holiday Affairs does not provide medical advice; travelers should consult a healthcare
                provider for medical concerns related to travel.</p>

                any

                activities.</p>
